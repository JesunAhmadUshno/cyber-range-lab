# SPEC: cyber-range-lab (P24)

Phase skill: spec-driven-development (house engineering pipeline).
Status: Wave 0 scaffold spec, from Roadmap v2 text and the v3 decision pack. Scope and acceptance criteria below are the v2 section text, kept as the source of truth until the project's wave opens its own spec pass.

Fleet node: Dell R610. Wave: Wave 5 (after P13).
Hiring evidence: scored in the fleet pass (new candidates P23 to P29: see the decision pack Sections 4 and 5) [confirmed, fleet and scoring pass 2026-11-04, or the decision pack for P23 to P29].

## Project section text (Roadmap v2, or the v3 candidate text for P23 to P29)

Subject: a cyber range on the isolated lab network (labnet 10.99.0.0/24, no route to the home LAN, no route to management interfaces) [confirmed, mission profile 2026-10-25].
Hard rules: snapshots are the reset; defensive work is the default scope; offensive work runs only as lab scenarios inside the isolation and only on Jesun's sign-off per scenario; no external targets; nothing leaves the range.
- Learn (this scaffold's scope): the hardening baseline on one lab VM: updates, least privilege, key-only access, logging on, with a before and after checklist.
- Build (later, gated): the detection loop end to end on one scenario: logs to one place, one alert on a named signal, one incident record.
- Deep (later, gated): further sign-off scenarios, each with a blue team report, plus the range runbook. Scenario content is NOT in this scaffold.

## Acceptance criteria (scaffold level)

- Learn closes when the level-1-learn code runs, its README teaches the idea, and a fresh-eyes reader can follow it.
- Build closes when the system runs end to end, tests pass, and one benchmark or result table with method is in the README.
- Deep closes when the Deep scope in the section text is done, the failure modes are written, and the dossier is updated to ship state.
- No level closes on a claim. Evidence only: code, tests, numbers, links.
